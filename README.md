# Thinking Au Jus
Version 1.4 - Static

## Description
This is the repository for my personal portfolio website [conormanning.com](https://conormanning.com). I have more plans for the actual site content, but a majority of the purpose in creating this website was to practice backend development and architecturing. <br>
Anything learned or improved in the way of front end development is purely coincidental!

## Infrastructure
I went ahead and started this on a node.js app serving the front end since eventually I will be calling apis for the sandwich application db. <br>

Currently the container is hosted in AWS as an EC2 instance. Eventually I will probably separate the frontend and backend as separate containers and have all of the sandwich data / images living in an S3 bucket. <br>

Updated systems map to come as I will probably also set up a moderately unecessary CI/CD pipeline.

## Coming Soon
- Sandwich meals DB as table for analysis.
- Random sandwich recommendations.
- Local sandwich heaven.
- (Maybe) prices and mapped recommendations.
