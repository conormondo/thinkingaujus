            <span id="age">0</span> year old Austin based developer who wants to automate everything. Currently working on integrations for B2B and B2C systems for mondoshop.com.

            I strongly believe in proper data hygeine and accesibility when it comes to working with as many endpoints as we do these days,
            I am also a musician who is apparently obsessed with sandwiches and the religious documenting of my local food moves.
            Feel free to follow along through the sandwich recommendation api that I will be building out here on this site!

          <p>My cat has also regularly "helped" me with my projects, so if anything doesn't work it was probably him.</p>
